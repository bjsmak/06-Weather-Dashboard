Weather-Dashboard

<a href ="https://bjsmak.github.io/06-Weather-Dashboard/">LINK TO APPLICATION HERE</a><p>
  
The purpose of this application is to use server-side APIs to display the weather.<p>
By utilizing OpenWeatherMapAPI, I was able to display the forecast for the current day as well as the 5-day forecast using ajax calls through jQuery. Dates and formats were done utilizing Moment JS.<p>

If you type into the search bar, the city typed in should display in the fields (note - if already used, the last searched city should display via local storage without having to apply the search):<p>

Previously searched cities will appear below, if clicked on they will generate the forecast for that city:<p>
